Description: This package implements outcome-guided clustering method with weighted joint likelihood approach for both continuous (ogClust) and survival data (ogClust_Surv), along with the data from two lung disease applications (GSE47460_GPL6480 and GSE47460_GPL14550) and two triple negative breast cancer applications (METABRIC and SCAN-B). These four datasets are used to show the superior performance of ogClust.WJL method in the paper. A function for search lambda grid for a given K is also included in the package. The code for reproducing the result in the paper is included at https://github.com/YujiaLi1994/ogClust.WJL
